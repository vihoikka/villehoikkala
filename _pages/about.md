Hi! I'm Ville, a postdoctoral biologist from Finland. I am currently working on type III CRISPR-Cas systems in the University of St Andrews in the cold but not that rainy east coast of Scotland. My research mostly focuses on the prokaryotic immune system CRISPR-Cas, and its interactions with prokaryotic viruses called bacteriophages. To see my academic publications, head over to [Publications](/villehoikkala/publications/).

I am also a cofounder of the Finnish biotech company [PrecisionPhage](https://www.precisionphage.com), where I lead the small but powerful bioinformatics team.

My formal training is in molecular biology, but my life-long interest in computers has slowly dragged me to the dark side and I am now at the point where I consider myself a fulltime bioinformatician. See [CV](/villehoikkala/cv/) for details.
